University Advising System Database
Overview
This repository contains the source code for a University Advising System, implemented using SQL for the database, C# for the backend and ASP.NET for the user interface. The system aims to streamline the advising process within a university, providing a centralized platform for students and advisors to manage academic-related activities.

Advisor Tools: Provide advisors with tools to track and manage their assigned students, view academic progress, and facilitate course selection.

Admin Page: A dedicated admin page for system management.

User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.

Getting Started
Database Setup: Execute Database.sql to set up the necessary database schema and populate initial data.

ASP.NET Application Setup: Open the ASP.NET solution in a compatible development environment (e.g., Visual Studio) and configure the connection strings to point to the created database.

Run the Application: Build and run the ASP.NET application to start the University Advising System.
